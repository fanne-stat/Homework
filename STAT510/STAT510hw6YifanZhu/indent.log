Processing switches
	-w|--overwrite: Overwrite mode active, will make a back up of STAT510hw6YifanZhu.tex first
Directory for backup files and indent.log: .
YAML settings read
	Reading defaultSettings.yaml from C:/texlive/2016/bin/win32/defaultSettings.yaml
	Reading defaultSettings.yaml (2nd attempt, TeXLive, Windows) from C:/texlive/2016/bin/win32/../../texmf-dist/scripts/latexindent/defaultSettings.yaml
	Home directory is C:\Users\fanne (didn't find either indentconfig.yaml or .indentconfig.yaml)
	To specify user settings you would put indentconfig.yaml here: C:\Users\fanne/indentconfig.yaml
	Alternatively, you can use the hidden file .indentconfig.yaml as: C:\Users\fanne/.indentconfig.yaml
Backup procedure (-w flag active):
	 ./STAT510hw6YifanZhu.bak0 already exists, incrementing by 1... (see maxNumberOfBackUps and onlyOneBackUp)
	copying STAT510hw6YifanZhu.tex to ./STAT510hw6YifanZhu.bak1
